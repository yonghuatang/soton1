\begin{abstract}
\setstretch{1.1}
\noindent Supersonic travel is a ubiquitous mode of transport that has been widely recognised since the 1960s. Humans rely on supersonic flights to traverse across vast landmasses in an efficient time. Not until recently, the future of aviation has been rendered uncertain due to the unforeseen pandemic. Nevertheless, this denotes a transformative period of the aviation industry, with the emergence of disruptive technologies and pivotal design features, in lieu of grounded flights. In this essay, we will primarily discuss about the background and renaissance of commercial supersonic transport, its prevailing challenges, proposed novel solutions and technologies, and the future sustainability.

\section{Subject Background}
\setstretch{1.25}

Humans have reached the skies since about a century ago, and we aspire to challenge the limits of aviation in terms of speed. The supersonic era has begun since USAF pilot Chuck Yeager first broke the sound barrier in 1947 aboard NACA's experimental Bell X-1 \cite{Smithsonian}.\\

The Soviet Union's Tupolev Tu-144 was the first commercial SST aircraft \cite{fg}, months before the Anglo-French Concorde. A typical subsonic flight would take 8 hours from New York to London, Concorde managed to make it in 3 hours \cite{simpleflying}! Concorde was mankind's greatest achievement in SST, which serviced from 1976 to 2003 \cite{washington}, eventually abolished following a fatal crash on 25 July 2000 \cite{aviationsafety}. Since then, supersonic flights have been discontinued, until recently pioneered by a few startup companies, such as Boom Technology, Aerion Supersonic and Spike Aerospace.\\

Besides the safety factor, Concorde ceased its operation due to bad economics, which implies that it had imperfections such as high fuel consumption rate and high MRO fees. It also had low customer demand, which only wealthy people could afford flying, and solely two airlines have operated Concorde \cite{britannica}.\\

Supersonic flight is defined as flying faster than the speed of sound (Mach 1) \cite{Anderson}. To attain Mach speeds, such aircraft must adopt designs such as swept-back delta wing, slender fuselage, light yet rigid materials \cite{wired}, and some with afterburner. There were some iconic designs such as Concorde's variable-angle nose, famously known as `droop-snoot' \cite{droop}.

\section{The Sustainable Future}

An aircraft needs to be robust and sustainable to survive swift elimination. We will elaborate on various sustainability aspects such as safety, sound pollution, environmental impact, novel technologies, fuel economy and ticket price.\\

Safety is an indispensable feature of an aircraft that must not be downplayed. The crash of Air France Flight 4590 has put Concorde into retirement three years later, despite being the only fatal accident during its 27-year operational history. Hence, several crucial modifications were made to the Concorde, including lining of fuel tank with impact-resistant Kevlar \cite{concordesafety}, improving its airworthiness. In addition, supersonic planes tend to be unstable during flight, hence they rely on flight computers to actuate the control surfaces to maintain stable flight. The integration of redundancies and ISIS in fly-by-wire systems is essential in case of instrumentation failure.\\

Another issue that SST has been facing is sound pollution. When cruising at supersonic speeds, it trails a boom carpet behind, destroying objects and causing distress when it flies past populated areas. Therefore, the laws only permit transatlantic supersonic flight \cite{mercatus}. Fortunately, we have had the capabilities to solve this issue, with technologies such as Aerion Supersonic's Boomless Cruise™ \cite{cnbc}, Lockheed Martin's X-59 QueSST \cite{quesst}, Quiet Spike \cite{quietspike} etc. Implementation of noise suppression technologies and better aeroacoustics design is vital to mitigate sonic boom.\\

\end{figure}

\vspace{0.5cm}

The next facet we must account is environmental impact. ATAG reported that ``the global aviation industry produces around 2\% of all human-induced CO$_{2}$ emissions'' \cite{atag}, and greenhouse gases can deplete the ozone layer, thus worsen our climate issue. In accordance with UN 13$^{\mathrm{th}}$ SDG (Climate Action) \cite{un} and the Paris Agreement \cite{imers}, we pursue to radically redefine green flights, using sustainable biofuel or synthetic fuel, and achieving 100\% carbon neutral. Moreover, fuel produced by extracting CO$_{2}$ from the air is not fictitious nowadays \cite{natgeo}.\\

During the supersonic regime, the airframe will heat up vigorously due to air friction. Lightweight materials such as titanium and carbon composite that can withstand prolonged exposure to high temperature are favourable to supercruising aircrafts. We also leverage additive manufacturing, fabricating parts in a more precise level. Thanks to today's advanced CFD and FEA simulation, we can have more efficient design and better understanding of sophisticated aerodynamics, to impede the onset of flow separation.\\

One of the biggest challenges in aviation is fuel consumption, which is also linked to the climate crisis. It is inevitably a trade-off between speed and fuel efficiency. Concorde notoriously used 50\% more fuel, carrying quarter amount of passenger and halved the maximum range \cite{Youtube4}. As drag is directly proportional to velocity squared, $D = \frac{1}{2}\rho_{\infty} V^{2}_{\infty}SC_{D}$, we need to burn immense fuel to generate thrust. We prioritise the aerodynamic design that allows maximum fuel efficiency, which it will improve dramatically compared to its predecessor Concorde.\\

Back in the days, it requires deep pockets to fly on the Concorde \cite{concordemoney}. People were willing to pay for exorbitant ticket price in exchange of time, and the visual factor. But now, supersonic flights are being developed to be more commercialised and business-class oriented, everyone can fly faster affordably and bearing lower operational cost. SST also ensures a sustainable job market, thus prosper the aviation sector and increases a country’s GDP.\\

\section{Conclusion}

The future of civil supersonic aviation will hinge on key points such as safety, reliability, cost, environmental impact \cite{keane} and most importantly, sustainability. Despite the pandemic situation, I believe that SST is robust and resilient.\\

Companies such as Boom Supersonic are progressively rolling out state-of-the-art planes in the supersonic realm. I conclude that it has the potential to be the mainstream aviation soon, making the world more connected. We persevere to realise our audacious dreams, to revive the marvellous legacy of supersonic flight in near future --- the sky is our only limit.\\
